# 00-00 Welcome

Hello to both newcomers and veterans of AE2.

This document is written so that even beginners to AE2 can gain all the knowledge necessary to handle AE2 at least at the author's level.

First and foremost, I explicitly state that this document is written for those who wish to work with **AE2 UEL on Minecraft 1.12.2**.

You've probably heard many times that AE2 is difficult, but if you've made it this far, it's safe to say you possess the minimum required aptitude. Rest assured **for now.**

Just to let you know up front, all AE2 add-ons (with a few exceptions) should be treated as welcome here, and some will be assumed as prerequisites in this guide.

Add-ons appearing for the first time will be indicated [like this](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-extended-life) with a linked name.

This chapter is now complete.

Strive to be smart and efficient. This means considering not only throughput but also factors like server load.

Good luck.
